# 🚀 My First Go Microservice Project 🚀

Welcome to my first Go microservice project! 🎉 In this project, I've explored a variety of modern technologies, communication patterns, and both SQL and NoSQL databases. 💻📡🗄️ I've also built a lightweight frontend to test the networking between all these microservices. 🌐🧪

## 🛠️ Technologies and Patterns 🛠️

In this project, I've used:

- Go for the backend microservices 🚀
- Both SQL and NoSQL databases 🗄️
- Various communication patterns for microservices 🔗
- Different Networking Protocols 🔌
- A lightweight frontend for testing 🌐

I've focused on understanding and implementing concepts like coupling and decoupling in the context of microservices. 🔗

📺 Watch the given video link for a video demonstration on how this works!

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to learn and grow my skills in microservices with Go! 🌱🚀

## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

To run the demo on your own PC, you'll need Docker installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ToxicalNoob3062/Dojo
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Dojo
   ```
3. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f ./project/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

That's it! Your application should now be running.
